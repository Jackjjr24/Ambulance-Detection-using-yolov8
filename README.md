## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to develop a robust model for detecting ambulances in real-time traffic scenarios. The model can be integrated into intelligent traffic management systems to prioritize emergency vehicles, thereby reducing response times and improving urban mobility.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training, validation, and testing was sourced from Roboflow. The dataset was split into:
- **Training:** 70%
- **Validation:** 20%
- **Testing:** 10%

The dataset contains a diverse set of images with annotations for ambulances.

## Model Architecture

The model is based on YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection architecture known for its speed and accuracy. YOLOv8 provides an efficient way to perform real-time object detection.

## Training and Validation

The training process was conducted on Google Colab, utilizing its GPU resources to expedite the process. The model was trained with the following parameters:
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Batch Size:** 16
- **Image Size:** 640x640 pixels

### Training Script

```python
!python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 50 --data /path/to/dataset.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --cache
```

## Results

The model achieved high accuracy in detecting ambulances, with excellent performance metrics across various confidence thresholds. Below is an F1-Confidence curve showing the model's performance:
